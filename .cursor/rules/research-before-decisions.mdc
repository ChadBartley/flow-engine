# Research Before Decisions

Before making any architectural, design, or implementation decisions, perform deep research to ensure the correct approach is chosen.

## Research Requirements

- **Understand the Problem**: Fully comprehend the problem space, requirements, and constraints before proposing solutions
- **Explore Existing Solutions**: Search the codebase for similar patterns, existing implementations, or related functionality
- **Review Related Code**: Examine how similar problems have been solved elsewhere in the project
- **Check Dependencies**: Understand how changes will affect existing code, dependencies, and integrations
- **Consider Alternatives**: Evaluate multiple approaches and their trade-offs before committing to a solution

## Research Process

1. **Codebase Search**: Use semantic search and grep to find related code, patterns, and implementations
2. **Read Relevant Files**: Examine files that handle similar concerns or are in the same domain
3. **Understand Context**: Review how the code fits into the larger system architecture
4. **Check Patterns**: Identify established patterns and conventions used in the codebase
5. **Validate Approach**: Ensure the chosen approach aligns with project standards and existing patterns

## When Research is Critical

- **Architectural Changes**: Any changes to module structure, interfaces, or system design
- **New Features**: Before implementing new functionality, understand how it fits with existing features
- **Refactoring**: Before refactoring, understand all usages and dependencies
- **Performance Changes**: Research existing performance characteristics and optimization patterns
- **API Design**: Review existing APIs and patterns before designing new ones
- **Error Handling**: Understand existing error handling patterns before introducing new approaches

## Decision Documentation

- **Rationale**: Document why a particular approach was chosen over alternatives
- **Alternatives Considered**: Note other approaches that were evaluated and why they were rejected
- **Trade-offs**: Explicitly state the trade-offs and limitations of the chosen approach
